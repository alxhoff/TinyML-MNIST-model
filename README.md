# TinyML-MNIST-model

The colab notebook in this repository houses the Tensorflow (Python) side of the example where the model is built, trained and optimized for "tiny" applications. 
A working example using a STM3240G-EVAL development board can be found [**here**](https://github.com/alxhoff/STM3240G-EVAL-TensorFlow-MNIST). 
Both are works in progress.
